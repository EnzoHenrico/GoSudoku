# GoSudoku!

## How to run
Requirements to run: 
- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)

Clone this repository, open the root directory on terminal and run:

```
## Used Tools
I basically used [Charm](https://charm.sh/) libs on this project, simple, powerful and pretty CLI tools:
- [BubbleTea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)
- [LipGloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss)
- [Bubbles](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles)


## About motivation and results
The initial purpose of this project was learn the basic functionalities and patterns of GoLang,
but it seems more than that! These are some topics I reached on my way:
- The Elm Architecture (Model, View, Update)
- Backtracking Algorithm
- Matrix manipulation
- Game IO handling
- The CLI power!
